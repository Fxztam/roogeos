RoOgeoS - Ring of Oracle GeoJSON Service.

The cooperation of modern, heterogeneous software systems can be achieved by interoperability of transparent data formats with standardized services. 
The GeoJSON data format for the exchange of geometry and attribute data has proven to be very assertive due to its transparency and efficiency. 

The following is a demonstration of the interoperability by low code and transparency in the data process, spatial data quality assurance, and service delivery.  

True to the definition of Geographical Information Systems (GIS)::

 	Input - Management - Analysis - Presentation  : The I M A P principle

is the following workflow implemented:

1. GeoJSON File - Storage in the Feature Table (Input)
1. Validation and Indexing (Management / Analyzing)
1. GeoJSON RESTful Data Service & Map viewing (Viewing) .

The workflow is implemeted with simple Python scripting as batch processing.
