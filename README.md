RoOgeoS - Ring of Oracle GeoJSON Service
#Introduction 
The cooperation of modern, heterogeneous software systems can be achieved by interoperability of transparent data formats with the standardized services. 
The GeoJSON data format for the exchange of geometry and attribute data has proven to be very assertive due to its transparency and efficiency. 

The following is a demonstration of the interoperability by low code and transparency in the data process, spatial data quality assurance, and service delivery.  
True to the definition of Geographical Information Systems (GIS)::

 **Input - Management - Analysis - Presentation **

is the following workflow implemented:
***GeoJSON File => Storage in Feature Table => Validation and Indexing => GeoJSON RESTful Data Service & Map viewing.***
