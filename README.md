RoOgeoS - Ring of Oracle GeoJSON Service.

# Intoduction

The cooperation of modern, heterogeneous software systems can be achieved by interoperability of transparent data formats with the standardized services. 
The GeoJSON data format for the exchange of geometry and attribute data has proven to be very assertive due to its transparency and efficiency. 

The following is a demonstration of the interoperability by low code and transparency in the data process, spatial data quality assurance, and service delivery.  

True to the definition of Geographical Information Systems (GIS)::

 	Input - Management - Analysis - Presentation :  The I M A P principe

is the following workflow implemented:



- GeoJSON File convert into DB Feature Table (Input)
- Validation and Indexing (Management & Analyzing)
- GeoJSON RESTful Data Service & Map viewing (Presentation) .
